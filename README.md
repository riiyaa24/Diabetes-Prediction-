# Hyrbid Model for Diabetes Predictions-

Objective 
The objective of creating a diabetes prediction model is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can accurately predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on certain features or risk factors. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention, allowing them to provide personalized preventive care and guidance to individuals at higher risk of diabetes. By identifying individuals who are more likely to develop diabetes, it becomes possible to take proactive measures to prevent or delay the onset of the disease, improving overall health outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
